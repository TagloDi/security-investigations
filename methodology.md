# Investigation Methodology

Across all investigations, the following general approach was applied:

1. Initial signal review to understand the scope and objective
2. Identification of relevant artifacts (logs, traffic, files, timestamps)
3. Hypothesis-driven analysis to determine suspicious vs benign behavior
4. Correlation of evidence across multiple data sources
5. Final assessment of root cause and impact
6. Documentation of findings and lessons learned

This methodology reflects foundational SOC and incident analysis practices.
