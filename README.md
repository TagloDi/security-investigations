# Security Investigations (Hands-On Labs)

This repository contains high-level investigation summaries from hands-on security analysis labs completed for skill development in:

- Alert triage and investigation
- Log and artifact analysis
- Network traffic inspection
- Phishing and intrusion analysis
- Analytical reasoning and documentation

All investigations were performed in controlled lab environments (Hack The Box Sherlocks).
These summaries intentionally avoid walkthroughs, flags, or exploit steps and instead focus on
analytical thinking, evidence interpretation, and conclusions—mirroring entry-level SOC workflows.

This repository is intended as a learning portfolio, not a record of production incident response.
