# Investigation Summary – GhostTrace

## Scenario Overview
This investigation simulated a security event involving suspicious activity on an endpoint.
The objective was to analyze system artifacts to identify anomalous behavior, understand the
sequence of events, and assess potential impact.

## Artifacts Analyzed
- Process execution and system activity artifacts
- Timeline-related data showing event progression
- Files and indicators associated with suspicious behavior

## Analytical Process
The investigation focused on reconstructing activity over time by reviewing execution traces
and system artifacts. Observed behavior was compared against expected baseline activity to
identify anomalies.

Correlation across artifacts helped determine whether the activity represented legitimate
system behavior or unauthorized execution. Particular attention was given to persistence
indicators and abnormal execution patterns.

## Findings
The analysis revealed activity inconsistent with normal endpoint behavior, indicating the
presence of unauthorized or suspicious execution. The collected artifacts supported a
malicious interpretation rather than benign system activity.

## Lessons Learned
This investigation highlighted the value of:
- Timeline reconstruction during endpoint analysis
- Understanding normal vs anomalous process behavior
- Correlating multiple artifact types to support conclusions
