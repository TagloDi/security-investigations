# GhostTrace – Endpoint Investigation Lab

This investigation focused on analyzing system-level artifacts associated with suspicious
endpoint behavior. The objective was to reconstruct activity over time and determine whether
observed behavior indicated malicious execution or persistence.

This lab was completed in a controlled environment for defensive investigation practice.
