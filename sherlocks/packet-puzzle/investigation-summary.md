# Investigation Summary – Packet Puzzle

## Scenario Overview
This investigation simulated a security alert involving potentially suspicious network activity.
The objective was to analyze network traffic artifacts and determine whether the observed
communication patterns indicated malicious behavior.

## Artifacts Analyzed
- Packet capture data
- Network communication patterns
- Protocol-level behavior and timing information

## Analytical Process
The analysis involved reviewing packet-level data to identify deviations from expected network
behavior. Traffic patterns were examined to determine whether communication was consistent with
legitimate usage or indicative of suspicious activity.

Correlation of protocol behavior and timing helped assess whether the traffic suggested
unauthorized communication or data exchange.

## Findings
The investigation identified anomalous network behavior inconsistent with normal traffic
patterns. The evidence supported a conclusion of suspicious activity rather than benign
network communication.

## Lessons Learned
This investigation reinforced the importance of:
- Understanding normal network traffic baselines
- Identifying anomalous communication patterns
- Using packet analysis to support accurate alert triage
