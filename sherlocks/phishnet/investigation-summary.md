# Investigation Summary – PhishNet

## Scenario Overview
This investigation simulated a security alert involving activity consistent with a phishing attempt.
The goal was to analyze available artifacts to determine whether the activity was malicious,
assess potential user interaction, and understand the overall impact.

## Artifacts Analyzed
- Email-related metadata and message content
- Embedded links and associated indicators
- Timeline details related to message delivery and user interaction

## Analytical Process
The analysis began with a review of email characteristics commonly associated with phishing,
including sender behavior, message structure, and the presence of suspicious links.
Indicators were examined to determine whether they aligned with known malicious patterns.

Artifacts were correlated to evaluate whether user interaction occurred and whether the activity
posed a risk of credential exposure or further compromise. Attention was paid to distinguishing
malicious intent from benign misconfiguration or spam.

## Findings
The investigation determined that the activity was consistent with a phishing attempt designed
to deceive users into interacting with malicious content. The indicators analyzed supported a
conclusion of malicious intent rather than a false positive.

## Lessons Learned
This investigation reinforced the importance of:
- Careful inspection of email metadata and content
- Validating indicators before escalation
- Understanding common phishing techniques to support accurate alert triage
